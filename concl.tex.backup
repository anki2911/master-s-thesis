\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{chap9}
\noindent
In this work, we have proposed a novel strategy for data distribution in a large-scale 
context aware distributed system. Experimental results show promising improvements in the 
number of transmissions. With context aware systems gaining widespread popularity in 
recent times, we believe our work will have interesting applications.

In this work we have restricted our analysis to in Propositional Boolean logic and linear temporal logic. 
We have shown here how we can exploit the semantics of the logic foundation to reduce the transmission 
of messages in a large scale context aware distributed system using the notion of contextual dissemination.

Our future work , we wish to extend our research to two main directions. 
On one side we wish to investigate the suitability of other higher order logic frameworks for efficient message dissemination.
on the other hand we intend to explore the application space that can benefit from our research proposal. In particular, 
we are investigating the area of vehicular networks which are 
known to be densely populated with multitude of message transmission. 
Vehicular network protocols executing in current generation automotives
typically demand the exchange of a large number of messages to coordinate the 
co-existence of numerous sensors and actuators on board to ensure safety of the vehicle. We believe that our methods
can be applied in this context to enable efficient transmission.

We have proposed the context rule modeling using propositional logic and then we extend our framework into
linear temporal logic. We experiment our framework in random environment using propositional logic. 
Our future work includes the following:
\begin{description}
 \item Experiment our framework using linear temporal logic.
 \item Compare our work with existing works in terms of energy or bandwidth.
 \item Extend our work into higher order logic families.
 \item Make our system fault tolerant and more robust.
